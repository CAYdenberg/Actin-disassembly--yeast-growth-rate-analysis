This code is designed to analyze growth curves produced by a Tecan plate reader, and generate a heatmap comparing strains to one another. It was for Fig 1 of an upcoming paper (not yet published). See the paper for a full description of the experiment.

The analysis occurs in two stages: in the first stage, text files output from the Tecan are placed in the `raw` directory (see one of these files for an example of formatting). The `get_rate.py` script is run, and this generates another text file (`growth_rates.txt`) listing the growth rate extracted from each column of each text file. From laboratory notes, strain numbers are added to another column and growth rates with low R2 values are replaced with growth rates determined by manual analysis. I did this in Excel and then saved the resulting file as `munged_growth_rates.txt`. Finally, the `growth.py` script is run, which generated the heatmap (in SVG format) and final table `growth_rates_parsed.txt`. I did some final editing in Illustrator and Excel to produce the publication version of these documents.
